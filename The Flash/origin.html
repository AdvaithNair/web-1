			<h2><u>Jay Garrick</u></h2>
			<p>
			After a strange and bizarre laboratory accident, Jay Garrick awoke to discover he had gained amazing abilities—he could move at superhuman speeds, far beyond those of any normal man or woman. Donning a costume and stylized metal helmet based on the one worn by the Roman god Mercury, Jay used his powers to fight crime and protect the citizens of Keystone City. He became the Fastest Man Alive, the Hero of Earth-2, the Flash!

			A founding member of the Justice Society of America—whose ranks include Green Lantern (Alan Scott), Hawkman, Hawkgirl, Wildcat, Power Girl and more—Jay was one of the first super heroes of Earth-2, a parallel world to the main DC Universe and home to the heroes of the Golden Age. As the Flash, Jay battled many super-criminals and saved the world alongside his friends numerous times. But he forever changed not only his world, but all worlds when he met his Earth-1 counterpart, Barry Allen. This famous meeting of the Flash of Two Worlds bridged the gap between realities and led to many team-ups, alignments and friendships between the heroes of both Earths. Together, the Flashes would join forces to battle Zoom, the Reverse-Flash, and many other super-villains.

			By tapping into the extra-dimensional Speed Force, Jay can move at speeds approaching the speed of light. This power also allows him to have faster than normal reflexes and grants him the ability to vibrate fast enough to obscure his features, preventing the need for him to wear a mask. His experience, compassion and kindness have led him to become a mentor to not only future generations of speedsters, but to countless other heroes throughout the DC Universe.
			
			The character of Jay Garrick was created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Harry Lampert. The character first appeared in the first issue of the anthology series Flash Comics in 1940, published by All-American Publications. He was soon featured in All-Star Comics as part of the Justice Society of America. In 1941, he got his own solo book, All-Flash. After World War II, superheroes declined in popularity. All-Flash was canceled in 1948 after 32 issues. Flash Comics was canceled in 1949 after 104 issues. All-Star Comics was canceled in 1951 after 57 issues, marking Garrick's last Golden Age appearance. Garrick would not appear again for ten years, and never got another solo series.

			In 1956, DC Comics reinvented the Flash character, giving him a new costume, name, and background. Named Barry Allen, he was completely unrelated to Jay Garrick. In fact, Garrick never existed as far as the new books were concerned. Barry Allen's first appearance shows him reading a copy of Flash Comics, lamenting Garrick was "just a character some writer dreamed up". Readers welcomed the new Flash, but still had an interest in the old one. Jay Garrick made a guest appearance in Flash #123. Garrick was treated as residing in a parallel universe, which allowed the character to exist without any continuity conflicts with Barry Allen yet allowed him to make guest appearances in Silver Age books. Garrick only made guest appearances for most of the 60s and 70s, but in 1976 he became a regular character in the revived All-Star Comics, partaking in adventures with the Justice Society set in modern times. In 1981, he and the Justice Society appeared in All-Star Squadron in stories set in World War II.

			In 1985, DC Comics merged all of its fictional characters into a single shared universe. Jay Garrick now shared the same world as the new Flash. DC wrote the character out of continuity in the one-shot Last Days of the Justice Society, but brought the character back in the 1990s due to fan interest. Unlike characters such as Batman or Superman, DC decided not to update Jay as a young hero, but portrayed him as a veteran of World War 2 with a magically-prolonged lifespan. Jay Garrick became a regular character in JSA and Justice Society of America.

			<h2><u>Barry Allen</u></h2>
			<p>
			Bartholomew Henry "Barry" Allen (born c. 1989) is a scientist in the Criminal and Forensic Science Division of Central City Police Department. Barry is the son of Henry Allen and Nora Allen, the foster son of Joe West, and the best friend/foster brother of Iris West. After the S.T.A.R. Labs particle accelerator exploded, it caused a giant thundercloud to form and Barry was struck by lightning, falling comatose for nine months. When he woke up from his coma, he discovered that he had developed superhuman speed and various other abilities derived from it. Using these super powers, he began acting as the vigilante and superhero known as Red Streak or The Streak. Soon after, the public recognized him as The Flash, stylized as the Scarlet Speedster.
			
			Having never grown up in the same household and with nothing to inhibit their romantic feelings, the original Barry Allen and Iris West fell in love and would eventually be married. At some point, Barry would join the forensics department of the Central City Police Department, and was eventually promoted as the director of the CSI division. He later created Gideon an A.I. program. In 2020, a particle accelerator created by Harrison Wells and Tess Morgan, gave Barry the power of super speed and a connection to the Speed Force, allowing him to become the superhero known as "The Flash", though it's unknown if Barry's wife knew of his secret. Sometime after becoming the Flash, he became a founding member of an unknown organization. In 2024, Barry engaged in a battle with his archenemy, the Reverse-Flash, along with Green Arrow, The Atom, and Hawkgirl atop two oil trucks in the streets. The battle ended with both speedsters vanishing in an explosion of light, unknown to anyone, the two speedsters actually traveled back in time, Barry was trying to stop Eobard from killing his younger-self, as the Reverse-Flash somehow discovered the Flash's real name.
			
			Barry Allen after being struck by lightning caused by the S.T.A.R. Labs particle accelerator.

			On his train back to Central City, Barry encountered Martin Stein and the two discuss physics and Harrison Wells' particle accelerator and how it would change the world. After he got off the train, he soon headed back to work, arriving to a crime scene late. He was successfully able to identify the getaway car from the robbery and also grabbed a sample of some animal feces found on the ground, before heading back to his lab to examine the evidence. While processing the feces, he was greeted by Iris West. Barry discussed the S.T.A.R. Labs particle accelerator, noting that it provided ideas that were far beyond their current capabilities of science, hence why he was so excited. Detective West approached right as the feces had processed. Barry described the results found, explaining that it had a chemical used only at four different farms around town, suggesting they check them out. Following, Barry and Iris headed to the unveiling and switching on of the particle accelerator. Barry attempted to convey his attraction towards Iris, but she simply misunderstood it. They began listening to S.T.A.R. Labs CEO Harrison Wells, who described how the particle accelerator would lead to a much greater future. As they were listening, a guy stole Iris' bag along with her laptop inside it. Barry ran after him, attempting to catch up to him, however the guy knocked the wind out of him and ran off (only to later get caught by Detective Eddie Thawne). At the police station, Iris and Barry mocked Eddie, a new transfer from Keystone City. Later Barry headed to his lab, watching the news of the S.T.A.R. Labs particle accelerator, but as he watched it, it became unstable. The particle accelerator sent a shock-wave through the city, and only seconds later was Barry struck by a red bolt of lightning through a window in the roof. He was sent backwards through the already-charged chemicals and was knocked unconscious. A red flash of light appeared across his cheek, rising, and then faded away.[11] He was quickly rushed to hospital, where he was kept on life support whilst in a coma.[6]

			For the following five weeks, Felicity Smoak visited Barry in the hospital while he was in a coma, and left only to help Oliver. Barry's heart constantly seemed to stop working, however it was concluded by Harrison Wells, who begun to visit him, that his heart was in fact beating too fast to even register.[6] Barry was visited by his friends and relatives at the hospital frequently. When Iris came by one day, she received a static shock as she grabbed Barry's hand. Barry was later visited by Eobard Thawne, who swore there would be a reckoning coming and that nothing has been forgiven.

			When Barry's condition began to worsen he was moved to S.T.A.R. Labs to be closely monitored and was frequently visited by Iris West.

			<h2><u>Wally West</u></h2>
			<p>
			Wally West was born to Rudolph and Mary West in Blue Valley, Nebraska. As a boy, Wally would often daydream, most notably about being the Flash. He idolized the Flash and was the president and sole member of the Blue Valley Flash Fan Club. His parents thought he was setting himself up for failure and did their best to dampen what they believed to be unrealistic expectations, in rather harsh ways. His father encouraged him to work at the same plant he did, but Wally grew frustrated and hurt (and eventually apathetic) by their lack of faith in his abilities.

			At a family reunion, hosted by the Wests, Wally accidentally spilled some soda, inciting his father to yell at him for being so careless. Wally quickly went to his room in tears. Once there, a familiar looking man, who he thought be his uncle, came in and began to speak to him. The man encouraged Wally not to give up on his dreams, giving him confidence that he would reflect back on for years to come.
			
			During the Crisis on Infinite Earths, after Barry Allen sacrificed his life to destroy the Anti-Monitor's antimatter cannon, an antimatter ray fired by the Anti-Monitor hit Wally full force. While it knocked his speed down to that of sound, it also removed the malady that caused him intense pain. Wally took Barry's uniform and declared himself the Flash, just until Barry returned. However, the rest of the population did not share Wally's feeling that Barry was still alive, and they also did not appreciate Wally's attempts at filling Barry's boots. After being publicly embarrassed in a fight with Doctor Alchemy, Green Lantern declared that he would protect Central City. For about a week, Wally donned his Kid Flash costume again. However, during the next fight with Doctor Alchemy, it finally dawned on him that Barry was not coming back. He saved Green Lantern and Jay Garrick from Doctor Alchemy. Finally, he was accepted as the Flash.
			
			After accepting that Barry was dead, Wally still had to overcome his anger of feeling abandoned, and forced into a role he did not feel ready for. Coupled with the emotional pain of what had happened with Raven, anger somehow overcame all the values that Barry had taught him, and he was rather rude and childish for a while. All these mental blocks also slowed him down, sometimes to the point where he lost his speed entirely. He also manifested the need to consume large quantities of food after using his powers, another product of his psychological condition.

			Wally won six and a half million dollars in the lottery. He was able to leave his small apartment in Brooklyn and buy a mansion on Long Island. He asked Frances Kane to live with him, and she accepted, for a short while. After two weeks, she left, saying they were moving too fast. Soon afterward, Wally invited nutritionist Tina McGee to live with him, even though she was eleven years his senior and not quite divorced. Wally's mother, Mary, also came to live with him, causing tension between the two women.

			After Tina left so that she could go back to her husband, Wally lost all of his money in the stock market, and had to move into a new apartment. Here, he befriended his neighbor, Mason Trollbridge. He also began seeing Connie Noleski, a Texan model who he had actually been living with for a short time before Tina.
